####Final words

Within data science we must be aware of the responsibility we have, the dangers and benefits of the analyzes we do every day, a well-known phrase "garbage in, garbage out", no matter how good your model is, with the most advanced technology or with the infrastructure you always dreamed of, if you feed your model or system with data that is "garbage" at the output you will get "garbage".
